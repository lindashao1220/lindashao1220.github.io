For the assignment we chose the cultures of Turkey, India, and Persia. These cultures are incredibly diverse. Turkish culture has a mix of Eastern and Western influences. It is known for its geometric patterns and calligraphy. Indian culture is rich with various traditions, languages, and colorful art, often portraying gods and stories. Persian culture, one of the oldest, features stunning artwork, miniatures, and architecture. 

In comparing the usability between the Harvard Art Museum (HAM) website and the provided CSV file, the website emerged as the more user-friendly option. The website allows for direct visualization of the art pieces, providing a more engaging and interactive experience. Additionally, the website offered convenient filters, making the artwork more accessible and easy to navigate. Using the website, we were able to explore the diverse art collections effortlessly. 

We chose an artwork that interested us from each of the cultures. The metadata was easily obtained from the HAM site. 

The Persian artwork we chose is titled "Young Man in a Blue Cloak" by Aqa Riza.
The classification of the artwork is under "Albums," indicating its placement within a specific category. The work type is identified as "painting," The artwork was created around the year 1587, placing it within the Safavid period, a significant era in Persian history known for its flourishing art and culture. It was created in Qazvin, Iran, a city located in the Middle East. 

The Indian artwork we chose is attributed to an unknown artist. The title of the piece is "A Prince Receives a Water Jug from a Young Woman at a Well,". It is classified under "Paintings". The artwork bears an approximate creation date of around 1745. It is from Kishangarh in Rajasthan, India. 

The Turkish artwork we chose is a tile fragment featuring intertwining split leaves and lotus flowers around a quadripartite cartouche. Classified as "Architectural Elements", it dates back to 1200 - 1300 during the Seljuks of Rum period in Türkiye (Turkey), part of the Middle East.

The metadata provided us with crucial details about the artist, culture, title, classification, work type, creation date, period, and the place of creation.

It was very hard to speculate on the most and least viewed objects. The first reason is the size of the database. There are so many objects in total and it is already hard for people to browse all of them, so evaluating them was even harder. Also, because of the algorithm complexity, it will be very intensive to process all the data. The second reason can be the lack of direct visibility. The API’s metadata often contains information like titles, descriptions, and links, but there is no direct information about how often this information has been viewed.

The numbers of the most and least viewed objects surprise us greatly. All three least-viewed objects from these cultures have zero views. However, as we browse through the basic information of these objects, we think they all demonstrate their artistic value and refined details, and they also belong to a relatively modern time period. After looking at these least-viewed items, we believe the reason is poor visibility; the websites may be overshadowed by other content. Another possible reason could be the lack of promotion, and it's possible that these objects are not part of the collection exhibition. As for the most-viewed items, the most-viewed page for Persian culture has been visited 21,380 times, which exceeds our expectations. For Indian culture, the most-viewed objects have been viewed 4,408 times. We can observe a significant gap in the numbers even though the total collection for both cultures is the same. We believe this difference in numbers is attributed to the kind of research people are conducting. Taking "Bahram Gur Fights the Horned Wolf" as an example, this painting reveals the cosmopolitanism of the Ilkhanid court in Tabriz, a place teeming with merchants, missionaries, and diplomats from as far away as Europe and China. Individuals conducting research on trade and diplomacy of European countries and China may all use this piece as a reference. 

As we browse through the result of the graph, We notice peaks in 1958, 1960, 1984, and 2002 for Persian culture, while the Indian culture collection's accession years are mainly in 1960 and 2009. We have looked into the data of the 2009 Indian culture collection, and most of them are gray-black ink drawings on paper with the same style. They can all date back to the 16th, 17th, or even 18th centuries. Since we didn't find any specific significant historical background, we guess the accession of the works is because of donations from an Indian museum or alumni who own a lot of the Indian drawings.

Overall, we can see there is a really small amount of Turkish artwork, comprising just 75 pieces in total. There may be several reasons for this. Firstly, there may not have been a lot of contributors donating Turkish work. Most of the donors, for example, the major one, Emily Pulitzer, donated 43 pieces of work at a time, which included important works of art by Picasso, Miró, Brancusi, Nauman, Serra, and Tuttle. We can observe that none of those artists produced Turkish culture-related work. Most of the work favored by the museum is from European countries and America. Second, historical factors can also be taken into account. America has never been a Muslim-majority country. As a result, there has been relatively less accumulation of Muslim art within the Harvard Art Museum.



We used the csv file to come up with visual representations of the data.

We notice that in the Persian word cloud, the word “manuscript” is the most prominent. By delving further into this aspect, it is worth noting that Persian manuscripts, primarily amassed in the early 20th century, owe their preservation to the distinguished Harvard alumnus, Bernard Berenson (1865–1959). Berenson cherished these invaluable works at his residence, Villa I Tatti, in Florence.  In a testament to his generosity and commitment to scholarship, he bequeathed this remarkable collection to Harvard, which has since become the Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies.
In a remarkable tribute to these treasures, Harvard hosted a captivating exhibition from May 20 to August 13, 2017.  This exhibition not only shed new light on Berenson's relatively obscure Persian collection but also celebrated the ongoing research efforts of numerous scholars.  It illuminated Berenson's eclectic collecting interests and underscored the profound artistic and cultural significance embedded within these splendid objects.
