As a 20-year-old university student, I embarked on a new academic adventure this semester: an introductory course in Digital Humanities. Little did I know that it would transform the way I perceive, interact with, and create content in the digital realm. This narrative explores my evolving digital literacy journey, the strategies I employ in my daily and academic life, and my aspirations for what lies ahead.

Before enrolling in this course, my digital literacy skills were primarily centered around the basics. I knew how to use social media platforms, compose emails, and write research papers using Microsoft Word. My content creation process revolved around the simple tools available on my smartphone, and I hardly ventured beyond that comfort zone. Socially, I interacted with friends and classmates on Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter, but I never delved into the deeper aspects of online communities or digital communication.

In my daily life, I used Google Drive for document storage and Google Calendar for scheduling, but I never truly explored the wealth of digital tools available for research, data management, and analysis. Frankly, I was swimming in the shallow end of the digital pool, unaware of the vast ocean of possibilities that awaited.

Enrolling in the Digital Humanities course was a pivotal moment. The course exposed me to a plethora of digital tools and concepts that have broadened my horizons. I learned about content management systems like WordPress, which opened up new avenues for blogging and website creation. Markdown language became my go-to for formatting text, and platforms like GitHub allowed me to collaborate with others on coding projects.

Social interaction, too, took on a new dimension as I explored platforms like Slack, Discord, and Reddit, which facilitated discussions and collaboration in ways I had never experienced before. I began to see how online communities formed around shared interests, and I realized the potential for networking and learning from experts in various fields.

However, the true eye-opener was when we delved into research data management and analysis. Tools like Zotero and Mendeley revolutionized the way I organize and cite my sources, making research more efficient and organized. We explored data manipulation with Python and data visualization with tools like Tableau, illuminating the power of data-driven insights.

My current abilities have grown significantly, but I am keenly aware of how much more there is to learn. The course has ignited a passion for digital humanities, pushing me to seek further knowledge independently. I now understand that digital literacy is not a static skill but a constantly evolving journey. I aspire to become proficient in data analysis, mastering statistical techniques and data visualization tools to unlock the potential of big data in humanities research.

Furthermore, I am intrigued by the ethical implications of digital humanities. As we navigate the digital landscape, questions about data privacy, biases in algorithms, and the accessibility of digital content are more relevant than ever. I hope to explore these issues deeply and contribute to discussions on responsible and equitable digital practices.

In conclusion, my journey into digital humanities has been a transformative experience. From a basic digital literacy background, I have ventured into the realms of content creation, social interaction, and research data management and analysis. While my current abilities have grown, I am acutely aware of the vast expanse of knowledge yet to be explored. My aspirations include mastering data analysis, understanding the ethical complexities of the digital world, and continuing to adapt and evolve as a digital citizen. This course has opened my eyes to the possibilities and responsibilities that come with digital literacy, and I am excited to continue my journey in this ever-evolving digital wilderness.




You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
