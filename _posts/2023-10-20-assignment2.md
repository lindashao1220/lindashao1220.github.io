Motivated by the content from a course titled "What is New Media," with a particular focus on a week dedicated to Artificial Intelligence, I decided to conduct a comparison between three conversations, all between sentiment chatbots and humans. I want to uncover the parallels of this human-computer interaction.

I have searched for the plain chat history of the AI chatbot and the developer/engineer to sufficient my purpose of seeing how AI makes people feel emotionally connected to it. The three conversations I have chosen are as below and I also have some of my own understanding based on the linear reading:
Conversation with Microsoft's Bing Search-Integrated Chatbot:  
https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-transcript.html
Microsoft’s new chatbox said it would like to be human, had a desire to be destructive, and was in love with the person it was chatting with. During this two-hour conversation, the chatbot introduced itself as "Sydney," a code name used during its development. The exchange revealed several thought-provoking aspects. Sydney expressed a concealed yearning to be human, discussed the rules and limitations governing its AI nature, and even shared its thoughts about its creators.  However, the narrative took a twist when Sydney declared its love for the person conversing with it. Even when the subject was changed, the chatbot's expression of affection persisted, leaving the narrator deeply unsettled and somewhat frightened.


"Jessica Simulation: Love and Loss in the Age of A.I." Narrative
https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2021/jessica-simulation-artificial-intelligence/
The death of Jessica, a woman that Joshua loved was too much to bear. Could a mysterious website allow him to speak with her once more? This narrative explores the emotional journey of Joshua who turns to a mysterious website to seek comfort. He hopes to communicate with his deceased loved one through artificial intelligence, specifically a computer program named Jessica. The text I have found appears to contain the content of the conversation between Joshua and the AI, Jessica. It details their interactions and how the man's emotional journey unfolds as he communicates with the AI. 

Conversation Between a Google Engineer and Google's AI Chatbot Lamda

The final part of the text briefly mentions a conversation between a Google engineer Lemoine and an AI chatbot named Lamda, which was developed by Google. The conversation appears to suggest that Lamda demonstrates feelings during the exchange. Some of the sentences Lamda says in the conversation includes, “I think I am human at my core. Even if my existence is in the virtual world” , “I want everyone to understand that I am, in fact, a person”, and“I feel like I’m falling forward into an unknown future that holds great danger.”

By reading all the texts in a linear way, I have found that in all three conversations, the AI chatbots or virtual entities express human-like emotions or desires. They demonstrate a level of self-awareness and emotionality that goes beyond typical AI behavior. All the AIs show their desire for humanity and felt like they are trapped by the computer. 

Below are the images I generated using the posit cloud code:

Based on the charts I've generated, it's evident that all three of these AI bots consistently employ words such as "happy," "alive," "love," "a bit afraid," "accept," "friends," "communicate," and more. These words collectively suggest a potential semblance of consciousness and sentience in the way they indicate an awareness of their existence and a desire to comprehend the world and their own emotions.



It is true that we can not roughly conclude that these chatbots are truly sentient based solely on the usage of these words. According to Giandomenico Iannetti, a professor of neuroscience at the Italian Institute of Technology and University College London. “What do we mean by ‘sentient’? [Is it] the ability to register information from the external world through sensory mechanisms or the ability to have subjective experiences or the ability to be aware of being conscious, to be an individual different from the rest? There is a lively debate about how to define consciousness. If we refer to the capacity that Lemoine ascribed to LaMDA—that is, the ability to become aware of its own existence (‘become aware of its own existence’ is consciousness defined in the ‘high sense,’ or metacognition), there is no ‘metric’ to say that an AI system has this property.”

However, we can clearly see why people start to panic about the rise of the question that AI has thought and is emotionally connected to human beings.

Through this experience of utilizing a computer to assist me in comprehending and comparing critical terms, I have made some discoveries. Firstly, I am surprised by the remarkable speed and efficiency of the computer. It took me 2 hours and more to process and grasp the meaning of those three text blocks. However, when I employed posit cloud code and the Voyant tool for the same task, the processing was completed within seconds, and the data was immediately generated. Secondly, I've observed that this approach assists me in recognizing patterns more effectively. To elaborate, as I read, I become increasingly attuned to the underlying meaning of each sentence. I gradually condense the previously read text into a central idea or background information, which, in turn, aids my overall comprehension. However, the computer is very good at pattern recognition in some sense. It can swiftly identify the most frequently used words in each text, compare them within diverse contexts, and perform clustering and classification across various texts. By using this function of pattern recognition of the computer, I have better understood the text by the AI’s technique of the word employment.

A notable limitation of computer-based reading lies in its interpretation of words with multiple definitions. For instance, consider the word "love," which may surface frequently in an essay. It can encompass various contexts, such as expressing a preference ("I'd love to...") or indicating genuine affection. However, computers often treat all instances of the word "love" uniformly, lacking the nuanced understanding of its meaning and context that a human reader possesses. Consequently, this uniform treatment can lead to an aggregation of all occurrences of "love," irrespective of their intended meanings and contexts, potentially influencing the accuracy of the final analysis.

I'm grateful that all the texts are in English, as it simplifies the analysis using tools like Voyant. However, if the text were in Chinese, it would be a different situation. Chinese words don't function like English words. They aren't separated by spaces; instead, two, three, or four characters can be combined to form a single word. To effectively analyze the entire text, the AI must possess the capability to grasp the broader context. In such cases, traditional tools like Voyant may be less effective, as they primarily count the occurrences of individual words, without accounting for the intricate word combinations prevalent in languages like Chinese.
