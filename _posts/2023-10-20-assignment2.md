For the assignment we chose the cultures of Turkey, India, and Persia. These cultures are incredibly diverse. Turkish culture has a mix of Eastern and Western influences. It is known for its geometric patterns and calligraphy. Indian culture is rich with various traditions, languages, and colorful art, often portraying gods and stories. Persian culture, one of the oldest, features stunning artwork, miniatures, and architecture. 

In comparing the usability between the Harvard Art Museum (HAM) website and the provided CSV file, the website emerged as the more user-friendly option. The website allows for direct visualization of the art pieces, providing a more engaging and interactive experience. Additionally, the website offered convenient filters, making the artwork more accessible and easy to navigate. Using the website, we were able to explore the diverse art collections effortlessly. 

We chose an artwork that interested us from each of the cultures. The metadata was easily obtained from the HAM site. 

The Persian artwork we chose is titled "Young Man in a Blue Cloak" by Aqa Riza.
The classification of the artwork is under "Albums," indicating its placement within a specific category. The work type is identified as "painting," The artwork was created around the year 1587, placing it within the Safavid period, a significant era in Persian history known for its flourishing art and culture. It was created in Qazvin, Iran, a city located in the Middle East. 

The Indian artwork we chose is attributed to an unknown artist. The title of the piece is "A Prince Receives a Water Jug from a Young Woman at a Well,". It is classified under "Paintings". The artwork bears an approximate creation date of around 1745. It is from Kishangarh in Rajasthan, India. 

The Turkish artwork we chose is a tile fragment featuring intertwining split leaves and lotus flowers around a quadripartite cartouche. Classified as "Architectural Elements", it dates back to 1200 - 1300 during the Seljuks of Rum period in Türkiye (Turkey), part of the Middle East.

The metadata provided us with crucial details about the artist, culture, title, classification, work type, creation date, period, and the place of creation.

It was very hard to speculate on the most and least viewed objects. The first reason is the size of the database. There are so many objects in total and it is already hard for people to browse all of them, so evaluating them was even harder. Also, because of the algorithm complexity, it will be very intensive to process all the data. The second reason can be the lack of direct visibility. The API’s metadata often contains information like titles, descriptions, and links, but there is no direct information about how often this information has been viewed. 

Most viewed Persian:

The numbers of the most and least viewed objects surprise us greatly. All three least-viewed objects from these cultures have zero views. However, as we browse through the basic information of these objects, we think they all demonstrate their artistic value and refined details, and they also belong to a relatively modern time period. After looking at these least-viewed items, we believe the reason is poor visibility; the websites may be overshadowed by other content. Another possible reason could be the lack of promotion, and it's possible that these objects are not part of the collection exhibition. As for the most-viewed items, the most-viewed page for Persian culture has been visited 21,380 times, which exceeds our expectations. For Indian culture, the most-viewed objects have been viewed 4,408 times. We can observe a significant gap in the numbers even though the total collection for both cultures is the same. We believe this difference in numbers is attributed to the kind of research people are conducting. Taking "Bahram Gur Fights the Horned Wolf" as an example, this painting reveals the cosmopolitanism of the Ilkhanid court in Tabriz, a place teeming with merchants, missionaries, and diplomats from as far away as Europe and China. Individuals conducting research on trade and diplomacy of European countries and China may all use this piece as a reference. 

As we browse through the result of the graph, We notice peaks in 1958, 1960, 1984, and 2002 for Persian culture, while the Indian culture collection's accession years are mainly in 1960 and 2009. We have looked into the data of the 2009 Indian culture collection, and most of them are gray-black ink drawings on paper with the same style. They can all date back to the 16th, 17th, or even 18th centuries. Since we didn't find any specific significant historical background, we guess the accession of the works is because of donations from an Indian museum or alumni who own a lot of the Indian drawings.

Overall, we can see there is a really small amount of Turkish artwork, comprising just 75 pieces in total. There may be several reasons for this. Firstly, there may not have been a lot of contributors donating Turkish work. Most of the donors, for example, the major one, Emily Pulitzer, donated 43 pieces of work at a time, which included important works of art by Picasso, Miró, Brancusi, Nauman, Serra, and Tuttle. We can observe that none of those artists produced Turkish culture-related work. Most of the work favored by the museum is from European countries and America. Second, historical factors can also be taken into account. America has never been a Muslim-majority country. As a result, there has been relatively less accumulation of Muslim art within the Harvard Art Museum.



We used the csv file to come up with visual representations of the data.

We notice that in the Persian word cloud, the word “manuscript” is the most prominent. By delving further into this aspect, it is worth noting that Persian manuscripts, primarily amassed in the early 20th century, owe their preservation to the distinguished Harvard alumnus, Bernard Berenson (1865–1959). Berenson cherished these invaluable works at his residence, Villa I Tatti, in Florence.  In a testament to his generosity and commitment to scholarship, he bequeathed this remarkable collection to Harvard, which has since become the Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies.
In a remarkable tribute to these treasures, Harvard hosted a captivating exhibition from May 20 to August 13, 2017.  This exhibition not only shed new light on Berenson's relatively obscure Persian collection but also celebrated the ongoing research efforts of numerous scholars.  It illuminated Berenson's eclectic collecting interests and underscored the profound artistic and cultural significance embedded within these splendid objects.


Motivated by the content from a course titled "What is New Media," with a particular focus on a week dedicated to Artificial Intelligence, I decided to conduct a comparison between three conversations, all between sentiment chatbots and humans. I want to uncover the parallels of this human-computer interaction.

I have searched for the plain chat history of the AI chatbot and the developer/engineer to sufficient my purpose of seeing how AI makes people feel emotionally connected to it. The three conversations I have chosen are as below and I also have some of my own understanding based on the linear reading:
Conversation with Microsoft's Bing Search-Integrated Chatbot:  
https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-transcript.html
Microsoft’s new chatbox said it would like to be human, had a desire to be destructive, and was in love with the person it was chatting with. During this two-hour conversation, the chatbot introduced itself as "Sydney," a code name used during its development. The exchange revealed several thought-provoking aspects. Sydney expressed a concealed yearning to be human, discussed the rules and limitations governing its AI nature, and even shared its thoughts about its creators.  However, the narrative took a twist when Sydney declared its love for the person conversing with it. Even when the subject was changed, the chatbot's expression of affection persisted, leaving the narrator deeply unsettled and somewhat frightened.


"Jessica Simulation: Love and Loss in the Age of A.I." Narrative
https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2021/jessica-simulation-artificial-intelligence/
The death of Jessica, a woman that Joshua loved was too much to bear. Could a mysterious website allow him to speak with her once more? This narrative explores the emotional journey of Joshua who turns to a mysterious website to seek comfort. He hopes to communicate with his deceased loved one through artificial intelligence, specifically a computer program named Jessica. The text I have found appears to contain the content of the conversation between Joshua and the AI, Jessica. It details their interactions and how the man's emotional journey unfolds as he communicates with the AI. 

Conversation Between a Google Engineer and Google's AI Chatbot Lamda
https://cajundiscordian.medium.com/is-lamda-sentient-an-interview-ea64d916d917
The final part of the text briefly mentions a conversation between a Google engineer Lemoine and an AI chatbot named Lamda, which was developed by Google. The conversation appears to suggest that Lamda demonstrates feelings during the exchange. Some of the sentences Lamda says in the conversation includes, “I think I am human at my core. Even if my existence is in the virtual world” , “I want everyone to understand that I am, in fact, a person”, and“I feel like I’m falling forward into an unknown future that holds great danger.”

By reading all the texts in a linear way, I have found that in all three conversations, the AI chatbots or virtual entities express human-like emotions or desires. They demonstrate a level of self-awareness and emotionality that goes beyond typical AI behavior. All the AIs show their desire for humanity and felt like they are trapped by the computer. 

Below are the images I generated using the posit cloud code:

<img src="/assets/images/7.png" style="zoom:80%"/>
<img src="/assets/images/8.png" style="zoom:80%"/>
<img src="/assets/images/9.png" style="zoom:80%"/>


Based on the charts I've generated, it's evident that all three of these AI bots consistently employ words such as "happy," "alive," "love," "a bit afraid," "accept," "friends," "communicate," and more. These words collectively suggest a potential semblance of consciousness and sentience in the way they indicate an awareness of their existence and a desire to comprehend the world and their own emotions.



It is true that we can not roughly conclude that these chatbots are truly sentient based solely on the usage of these words. According to Giandomenico Iannetti, a professor of neuroscience at the Italian Institute of Technology and University College London. “What do we mean by ‘sentient’? [Is it] the ability to register information from the external world through sensory mechanisms or the ability to have subjective experiences or the ability to be aware of being conscious, to be an individual different from the rest? There is a lively debate about how to define consciousness. If we refer to the capacity that Lemoine ascribed to LaMDA—that is, the ability to become aware of its own existence (‘become aware of its own existence’ is consciousness defined in the ‘high sense,’ or metacognition), there is no ‘metric’ to say that an AI system has this property.”

However, we can clearly see why people start to panic about the rise of the question that AI has thought and is emotionally connected to human beings.

Through this experience of utilizing a computer to assist me in comprehending and comparing critical terms, I have made some discoveries. Firstly, I am surprised by the remarkable speed and efficiency of the computer. It took me 2 hours and more to process and grasp the meaning of those three text blocks. However, when I employed posit cloud code and the Voyant tool for the same task, the processing was completed within seconds, and the data was immediately generated. Secondly, I've observed that this approach assists me in recognizing patterns more effectively. To elaborate, as I read, I become increasingly attuned to the underlying meaning of each sentence. I gradually condense the previously read text into a central idea or background information, which, in turn, aids my overall comprehension. However, the computer is very good at pattern recognition in some sense. It can swiftly identify the most frequently used words in each text, compare them within diverse contexts, and perform clustering and classification across various texts. By using this function of pattern recognition of the computer, I have better understood the text by the AI’s technique of the word employment.

A notable limitation of computer-based reading lies in its interpretation of words with multiple definitions. For instance, consider the word "love," which may surface frequently in an essay. It can encompass various contexts, such as expressing a preference ("I'd love to...") or indicating genuine affection. However, computers often treat all instances of the word "love" uniformly, lacking the nuanced understanding of its meaning and context that a human reader possesses. Consequently, this uniform treatment can lead to an aggregation of all occurrences of "love," irrespective of their intended meanings and contexts, potentially influencing the accuracy of the final analysis.

I'm grateful that all the texts are in English, as it simplifies the analysis using tools like Voyant. However, if the text were in Chinese, it would be a different situation. Chinese words don't function like English words. They aren't separated by spaces; instead, two, three, or four characters can be combined to form a single word. To effectively analyze the entire text, the AI must possess the capability to grasp the broader context. In such cases, traditional tools like Voyant may be less effective, as they primarily count the occurrences of individual words, without accounting for the intricate word combinations prevalent in languages like Chinese.
